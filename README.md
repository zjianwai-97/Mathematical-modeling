# Mathematical-modeling
 First things, I loaded the titanic dataset into python to perform EDA. I got basic information about the dataset. I checked the number of duplicate values if they are present in the data. I found the number of unique values in the particular column using unique() function in python.  I visualized the unique values present in the data. For this, I used the seaborn library. I called the sns.countlot() function and specified the variable to plot the count plot. I also find null values and datatypes. Next, I filered the data and created box plots for numerical columnes using a single line of code. Furthermore, I found the correlation among the variables, that I could make use of the correlation function. This gave me a fair idea of the correlation strength between different variables. Last but not least, I visualized the correlation matrix using seaborn library. 
  For the diffculities, the main problem is I didn't know anything about coding before. I only start to learn a little bit about it recently. I also found problem to search for suitable platform or software to write the coding. I tried Python and Online's Jupiter Notebook, but it didn't go through really well until I use Jupiter Notebook in Anaconda then I start to write coding smoothly. I also realized there are a lot of different way to write coding, which confused me in the beginning.
